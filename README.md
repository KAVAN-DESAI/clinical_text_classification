## About the Project:

Problem : Clinical Text CLassification
- [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions)

- Implementation: I had taken inspiration from [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions), and implemented with the help of Sklearn's ML Library and some data manipulation libraries


## Preprocessing:

- The proprocessing part, is loading the data, and then applying some text cleaning techniques, for making aclean data available for the model to train, and then handling class imbalance, applying Machine Learning algorithms and observing the perdiction outcomes of the model.

## Models used:

- The model used are:
1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression (Multi Class)
3. LightGBM

## Flow of the Project:
